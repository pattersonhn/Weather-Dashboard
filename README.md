# Weather-Dashboard

## User Story
* As a developer, I want to create an application that allows users to search a city for it's current and future weather forecast.

## Acceptance Criteria
* WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed.
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
